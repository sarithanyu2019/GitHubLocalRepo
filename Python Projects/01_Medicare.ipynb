    "# Introduction\n",

    "Nationwide 44 million Americans are on Medicare which is 15% of the population. Currently, Medicare accounts of 2.9% of GDP. However, over the next 30 years that number is expected to grow to 5.9%.  Since most Medicare laws vary at the state level, we decided to take a more micro approach in our analysis to explore and analyze these rising healthcare costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we evaluate Medicare at the both the provider and state level data on patient outcomes and procedure prices.  Our goal is to both illustrate the nuances across a select number of states and help guide our readers on their own health care decisions in an attempt to address the significant challenges in the healthcare industry today.

    "# 1. Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes identifying information about each provider, along with their Score (which relates to the amount of Medicare costs. See below for full definition of Score). **The Score is the main datapoint of interest in this dataset.** Medicare can use this information to determine which providers cost them more money, on a national scale, compared with the national median. **Medicare calculates this score, along with other measures focused on improvement and achievement, to analyze provider performance and present this data to the public.** This MSPB Score is of great significance today, as we as a country are grappling with rising healthcare costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scores >1 are associated with Providers that have higher costs per patient compared to the national median, and Scores <1 are associated with Providers that have lower costs per patient compared to the national median.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "**While cost is only one component of clinical care, it must be examined to develop a comprehensive analysis of healthcare today.** Medicare has developed innovative ways to decrease costs, and **identifying the MSPB Score is one tool they have developed to understand costs at a national level.** Our objective is to explore the potential for Medicare to use this data to identify hospitals or certain geographic areas that have lower costs than the national median and to analyze New York City providers in particular. If these analyses are possible, then Medicare can study certain providers' cost-control practices. Medicare can then work to spread these best practices to other providers in an attempt to curb the rising healthcare costs in this country."

Looking specifically at New York, we see that New York has 27 providers with null Scores, which is is in the middle of the group when compared with other states. However, New York has one of the lowest percentage null scores out of all states, at 15.9% and shown in the above graph, so **we will continue to move forward analyzing New York since there seems to be a lot of data for this state. **"

    "This dataset is used for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, mandated by the Affordable Care Act, requiring the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to reduce payments to Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions rates (ERRs) are measured by a ratio, calculated by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. Therefore, providers with lower ERR scores would be considered better by CMS standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Examine the excess readmission rates of providers across the country.\n",
    "2. Test whether excess readmission rates are impacted by the volume of patients that a provider handles.\n",
    "3. Find the overall best ERR rated providers in the country.\n",
    "4. Test whether expensive providers with higher costs of treatment have better ERR scores.\n",
    "5. Examine the spread of good providers with low excess readmission rates across all US states.\n",
    "6. Check whether ERR and actual readmission rates are correlated.\n",
    "7. Find the best providers in New York state for the six medical conditions that are mentioned above.\n",
    "8. Asses the chances of readmission for each of the medical conditions.\n",
    "9. Describe the prevalence of each medical condition. "

In this dataset, Medicare is specifically examining the readmission rates per six different medical condintions for each of the providers. The six medical conditions are: heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n",

    "**Predicted Readmission Rate:** The number of readmissions (following discharge for medical condition) that would be anticipated in the particular provider, given the patient case mix and the hospital's unique quality of care effect on readmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Readmission Rate:** The number of readmissions (following discharge for medical condition) that would be expected if the same patients with the same characteristics had instead been treated at an \"average\" hospital, given the \"average\" hospital's quality of care effect on readmission for patients with that condition.\n",

    "The Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File (Inpatient PUF) provides information on inpatient discharges for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The Inpatient PUF includes information on utilization, payment (total payment and Medicare payment), and hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments. The PUF is organized by hospital and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) and covers Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. MS-DRGs included in the PUF represent more than 7 million discharges or 75 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges.\n",

Medicare has developed innovative ways to decrease costs, and **identifying the MSPB Score is one tool they have developed to understand costs at a national level.** This has the potential to look at hospitals that have lower costs than the national median, and study their practices, to see if best practices can be spread to other providers as well. \n",

    "**Note:** This dataset is unique in that nearly all values are present for the parameters provided. The only missing data is in the \"score\" column. MD didn't provide medicare scores for their providers (dataset B). However, the data is  not 100% comprehensive. We observed, as you will see below, the data isn't available for all states **and** all procedures. While all procedures might not be performed in every state, we do not believe that is a fair conclusion for the missing data. For example, data on heart transplants (DRG 001) are only present in 32 states. We believe Heart Transplants occur in all 50 states. Consequently, we caveat our finding with that limitaiton. "

    "Looking at these histograms and the descriptive statistics we see an interesting pattern. First, Maryland seems to have the best medicare coverage. This suggests that the heart transplant is indicative of their other proecures. Second, in New York, the mean remaining balance is 17%, which is just below the national average of 18%. This is also inline with thier distribution as it pertains to heart transplants. \n",

If a patient needs a heart transplant in Alabama, which will cost at a minimum 100k, and they are liable for almost 50k. It would seem this will likely put the patient in debt should they survive the procedure."

    "Based on our findings when controlling for state and diagnosis, in addition to our other variables, our model still only captures **~28%** of the variation in what patients are left to cover after Medicare. Consequently, we are likely missing some key variables. If we were to further analyze Medicare Payments, we dive deeper into two areas **1)** Patient outcomes and health measures of the population, i.e obesity and smoking rates, **2)** Policy decisions over time. Medicare is set at the state level. We might be able to find clearer patterns by analyzing the data over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we did find one particularly interesting finding. In regressions 1-3 the variable \"percent_of_state_population_on_medicare\" has a large **negative** and statistically significant coefficient. However, in regression 4, when we control for both state and DRG fixed effects, the sign flips. There is now a large **positive** and statistically significant coefficient. Our hypothesis is that politicians might be more likely to advocate for better coverage since it impacts a larger percent of the population."

    "We had a narrow view of medical data, but our initial findings leave us with two key takeaways. First, in order to make more robust conclusions, we need to analyze the data over time, at the county level, and introduce more variables that affect health outcomes. Second, one way Medicare is currently looking to manage costs is through evidence-based practices for both patient management and business outcomes. These analyses can be taken as a step towards achieving this goal.\n"
